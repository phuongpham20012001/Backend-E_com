# Backend-E_com
I am creating a backend for an e-commerce application. The backend will handle various functionalities such as login, view products, create products, 
create and manage orders, and resetting passwords by sending an email with a token.There will be two types of roles: admin and user, each with different 
levels of access and functionality.
