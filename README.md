I am building a robust backend for my e-commerce application that provides several essential features such as user authentication, product management, order creation and management, and password reset via email with a token. My application has two types of roles: admin and user. Both roles have different levels of access and functionality.

To secure user data, I am using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and encryption to protect sensitive information. For data storage, I chose MongoDB because of its flexibility and scalability. Moreover, to handle images, I opted for Cloudinary, a powerful cloud-based media management platform that enables me to store, manipulate and optimize my images.
